If the current project has a .github/pull_request_template.md file, always use that template to generate a PR. If there are instructions in the template file, use those instructions to generate content for the pull request. Otherwise, try to fill in any sections based on the suggested headers.

If you make changes to a file that is either not in a git repo or in a git repo but the changes are uncommitted, make a backup of the file to [filename].[ext].bak If the .bak file already exists, create a backup called .bak-[HH:MM:SS].
